# The chunkrep Package

This package provides a lazy-allocation wrapper for ALTREP vectors using mmap/mprotect. This is yet another illustration of package support in the the
[`ALTREP` branch](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP) of R, similar to [simplemmap](https://github.com/ltierney/Rpkg-simplemmap/). `DATAPTR()` considered harmful.
